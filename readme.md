# Hunt & Gather - (Employee Training Software Application)

## Purpose:


## *WIP on the intro data.
- To lessen the time and cost spent training employees. 
- This application will allow a new employee to learn the job faster and will consolidate the need for two men on one job the entire time training. 
- Will also be indespensible when current employees need to switch to an unfamiliar route or learn a new route.

   - Comman cenario: John is out sick today, but for some reason no one on the job today has ran the route before. Normally the employee would have to shadow john for a few hours on a previous day, or entire day to get the hang of the route. Using the app all the information they need will be avaiable via a webapp hosted on the companies internal server that the employee can access on their mobile device, but is unavailble outside of the plant. No download is needed and will run on any device. The application will tell the employee everything they need to know about the new route and will serve as a pocket trainer until they know the route as well as John.

When an emp is set to learn a route, it usually takes at least one day (can take up to 3 with new hires to get as familiar as they really need to be.) and the focus of 2 men. THe employee needs to know the location of every part, which parts run the fastest and other vital information. Information can be curated about each routes special quirks that normally take a good while to learn. Usually all these thigs are learned through repetion and a lot of the time a new employee can feel overwhemled trying to juggle all the locations and keep up with the fastest running parts, and offer information and techniques to elp an employee multitask as they need to do.. THe use of this application will take the pressure off of the trainer and the trainee and also seve as detailed pocket refernce as well, until they no longer needd it. but will come in handy in a pinch and alos be avainalbe te next time they need to learn a new routhe..

## Idea:

Employees will no longer need to be shadowed for a period of days. Using this application, an employee will:
  1. Know all part locations without having to spend unneccasary time through trial and error.
  2. (*)Know what parts need the most attention. 
  3. Have a full description of the part.
  4. Have an image indentifier for the part.
  5. Have access to a map to show the part location from the home route.
  6. Have the option of a generated checklist the employee can use to ensure the parts they need and make less trips for forgotten parts.

Supervisors will get vital information from the application user:
 - Employee\supervisor paging system: (*)Currently only one way communication.
    1. Employees may be reached by the supervisor without knowing their personal information. Phone number.
    2. Supervisors may  be reached by the employee without knowing their personal information. Phone number.

The employess route and parts maintained for the day can be tallied and reported by the end of the shift.   
Ultimately the consumption of a routes parts may be tracked for long periods of time in this manner and will make available useful infromation to the supervisor.

## Basic application usage:
##Edit this to account for the use of phase one, which will not require registration
  1. Employee will register their information with the application.
  2. Employee wil log in, and may stay logged in.
  3. The 'HomePage' presented will be a simple option list from which they will select their designated route.
  4. A simple list, ordered by High to Low will then be generated from the parts database.
    - The list will be comprised of:
        - Part ID - Part Location - Part info - Part add to list
        - Part info will give extra data about the part, picture and simple map to exact location.
        - An employee may generate a personal checklist from here by "Adding" the part to a list with a click\tap.
  5. Once the employee has gathered the needed items for the current run, A list will be generated to be checked off
     as each part is aquired. 
  6. At any time a report may be generated, and said report can be emailed to the supervisor.

* ## Parts classification:

  All parts will be rated on a 3 tier system, ordered and color coded by rate of consumption.
    - Red - High runners.
    - Orange - Medium runners.
    - Blue - Low runners.
    The parts may be sorted by the way they are located on the line, or by rate of use.

* ## Paging System:
    - The supervisor and employess will be able to send text messages directly to each other without the need to
      share phone numbers. This feature is in Beta and currrenly only allows th communucation to be sent one way.    
    - There is no need for the pagee to be logged into the system to receive a text. The application uses the persons
      personal phone number they submit at registration but the numbers are only known by the application. The pager
      must be logged in to issue a "Page".  
<br><br>
## Production Phases:

The application will be produced in five different phases.
   * Phase I
      - A simple dynamically produced page that connects to a database. Users will not log in and everyone will see the same data. It is in this phase I plan to work out some of the kinks for the basic UI.
      - Basic checklist generation.
   * Phase II
      - User\Supervisor registration and login will be implemented along with better overall design. Navbar for quick site navigation. Fully formed Database entries with image and product description.
   * Phase III
      - Implementation of user generated reports to be emailed to the supervisor. 
   * Phase IV
      - Fully functional messaging system to be used between super and employee.
   * Phase V
      - Integrated QR Scanner to make checklists faster and easier.   

## Future Proposed features:
 - a QR scanner to allow an employees to simply scan a part and generate a checklist. No need to hand select a part.
 - A 2 way texting feature that will work SMS both ways. As it is it will stil keep an employess\supervisors info private.
<br><br><br>

## Realistic thoughts about the project:

Some of these features would become cumbersome to seasoned employees, in fact, they all would. Once an employee knows their route there will be little to no need to use this application, save the the benefits of tracking parts for a particular route or to use as a communication portal without sharing personal information. However the benefits mostly lie with the introduction of new employees so they can do their job more effeciently sooner, and the bells and whisltes are just demonstrative of the skill set I employ.

 # Disclaimer:

 This application is in no way meant to be affiliated with my current employer. It is only being used as a model for a personal portofolio project, and no property (Part numbers or route names) will be used in the production of said software. I am using my experience as a material handler to solve a problem I have encountered in my day to day life, in the hopes of demonstrating my skills as a software developer to future prospected employers.
