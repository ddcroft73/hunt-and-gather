# Hunt & Gather - (Employee Training Software Application)

## Purpose:


- Lessen the time and cost spent training employees. 
- Allow a new employee to learn the job faster. 
- Allow for far less time shadowing a trainer.
- Allow current employess to learn a new route without a trainer.

## Usage Scenario 1:
A new employee has been hired. A current employee is used to train them as per usual, and in addition to the normal trial and error of learning the route and all the nuances of how the route runs, the new employee will have access to am application that will allow them to locate any part as needed, without the help of the trainer, once they have an idea of how the route is ran. This will allow for the training process to take far less time from the trainer and they can resume duties elsewhere.
  
## Usage Scenario 2:
Employee 1 is absent, and no other employee on shift has ran their route. Employee 2 gets assigned to the route and although they have never ran it they can immediately have all the relevent information to run the route successfully.

THe alternative is to put two men on the route days ahead and occupy the time of both men until employee 2 is up to speed. Or to send employee 2 into the wild, blind and hope they figure it out

## Application Benefits:

Employees will no longer need to be shadowed for a period of days. Using this application, an employee will:
  1. Know all part locations without having to spend unneccasary time through trial and error.
  2. Know what parts need the most attention. 
  3. Have a full description of the part.
  4. Have an image indentifier for the part.
  5. Generate a shopping list to be used each time they need to replenish the route.

Supervisors will get vital information from the application user:
 - Employee\supervisor paging system: 
    1. Employees may be reached by the supervisor without knowing their personal information. Phone number.
    2. Supervisors may  be reached by the employee without knowing their personal information. Phone number.
 - Daily report:
   - The parts used can be tracked for the day, week, month and the results may be reported to the supervisor at any time.

## Basic application usage to find part information:
The app will be developed in stages from simple general usage, and finally with custom settings and stats for employees and supervisors.
THe app is designed to run in  the users browser on any devise and will be hostedd on the companies server. Only to be accesed inside the plant.
  1. If needed the employees and supervisors will register and login, Users may remain loggedd for up to one month. (stage 2)
  2. A landing page with the users stats and info will be loaded on login, and the user will make choices as to what they need to do.
     
  3. User will select 'Routes' and will be  presented with a simple option list from which they will select their designated route.
  4. A simple list, ordered by High to Low runners will then be generated from the parts database.
    - The list will be comprised of:
        - Part ID - Part Location - Part info - Add to shop list, Delete from shop list
        - Each one can be selected for more info.
        - An employee may generate a personal check\shopping list from here by "Adding" the part to a list with a click\tap.  
  5. At any time a report may be generated, and said report can be emailed to the supervisor.

## Parts classification:

  All parts will be rated on a 3 tier system, ordered and color coded by rate of consumption.
    - Red - High runners.
    - Orange - Medium runners.
    - Blue - Low runners.
    The parts may be sorted by the way they are located on the line, or by rate of use.

## Paging System:
    - The supervisor and employess will be able to send text messages directly to each other without the need to
      share phone numbers. This feature is in Beta and currrenly only allows th communucation to be sent one way.    
    - There is no need for the pagee to be logged into the system to receive a text. The application uses the persons
      personal phone number they submit at registration but the numbers are only known by the application. The pager
      must be logged in to issue a "Page".

## Production Phases:

The application will be produced in four different phases.
   * Phase I
      - A simple dynamically produced page that connects to a database. Users will not log in and everyone will see the same data. It is in this phase I plan to work out some of the kinks for the basic UI.
      - Basic checklist generation.
   * Phase II
      - User\Supervisor registration and login will be implemented along with better overall design. Fully formed Database entries with image and product description.
   * Phase III
      - Implementation of user generated reports to be emailed to the supervisor. 
   * Phase IV
      - Fully functional messaging system to be used between super and employee.
   
## An even better Solution:
A more modern, faster and cleaner solution that would yeild a very intuitve application would be to bui;d the app that reads the QR code from each and every part in the plant. THis would then invoke the app to display countless information about each part, and then allow logistics and other personell to manipulate and compie the data as needed. THere could be many different tiers of access depending on the employee logged in.


## Realistic thoughts about the project:

I am building this as an addition to my portfolio to present to prospected future employers, and offer a description of my skills.  I think something like this could be useful and help employees to learn faster, better and although I wouldnt expect them all to use it all the time. It would be indespensble for the reasons I have listed.

 # Disclaimer:
Although it is tightly based on my current employers process, THe application will contain no propretary info and ofger no access to private property. Intelectual or otherwise.
